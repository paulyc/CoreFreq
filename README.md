# CoreFreq
## Purpose
CoreFreq, a CPU monitoring software with BIOS like functionalities, is designed for the 64-bits Processors of architecture Intel Atom, Core2, Nehalem, SandyBridge and superiors; AMD Families 0Fh, 17h (Zen)

CoreFreq provides a framework to retrieve CPU data with a high degree of precision:

* Core frequencies & ratios; SpeedStep (EIST), Turbo Boost, Hyper-Threading (HTT) and Base Clock
* Performance counters including Time Stamp Counter (TSC), Unhalted Core Cycles (UCC), Unhalted Reference Cycles (URC)
* Number of instructions per cycle or second, IPS, IPC, or CPI
* CPU C-States C0 C1 C3 C6 C7 - C1E - Auto/UnDemotion of C1 C3
* DTS Temperature and Tjunction Max, Thermal Monitoring TM1 TM2 state, Vcore
* Topology map including Caches for boostrap & application CPU
* Processor features, brand & architecture strings
* In progress: Uncore, Memory Controller channels & geometry, DIMM timings,  
  Stress tools, Power & Energy (RAPL, OSPM, HWP, TDP), Overclocking, cpuidle & cpufreq driver  


To reach this goal, CoreFreq implements a Linux Kernel module which employs the followings:

* asm code to keep as near as possible the readings of the performance counters;
* per-CPU, implements slab data memory and high-resolution timer;
* compliant with suspend / resume and CPU Hot-Plug;
* a shared memory to protect kernel from the user-space part of the software;
* atomic synchronization of threads to avoid mutexes and deadlock.

## Build & Run

### Prerequisites

**a-** For a better accuracy, *disable* the Kernel *NMI Watchdog*  

Add the below parameter in the kernel boot loader (Grub, SysLinux)  
The NMI Watchdog and the CoreFreq driver are conflicting on the ownership of the fixed performance counters  

```
nmi_watchdog=0
```

**b-** No Virtualization  

VMs don't provide access to the registers that the CoreFreq driver employs :
* Fixed Performance Counters 
* Model Specific Registers 
* PCI Registers 

**c-** Rendering  

The UI renders best with an ASCII 7-Bit console or Xterm with VT100 and ANSI colors support

## Q&A

* Q: Turbo Technology is activated however CPUs don't reach those frequencies ?  
* Q: The CPU ratio does not go above its minimum value ?  
* Q: The UI shows erratic counters values !  

  A: In the kernel boot command argument line, *disable the NMI Watchdog*  
```
nmi_watchdog=0
```

  A: a NMI alternative is proposed in the `Makefile` to make use of the `APERF/MPERF` registers  

```
make help	# for instructions usage
make info	# for the current settings
```

* Q: The Processor does not enter the C-States ?  
  A: Check if at least one Idle driver is running.  
     Accordingly to the Processor specs, provide a max_cstate value in the kernel argument as below.  
```
intel_idle.max_cstate=value
```
  A: CoreFreq can also register itself as a cpuidle driver.  
  This time, any idle driver will have to be blacklisted in the kernel command line; such as:
```
modprobe.blacklist=intel_cstate idle=halt intel_idle.max_cstate=0
```
  Start the CoreFreq driver with the `Register_CPU_Idle` parameter:  
```
insmod corefreqk.ko Register_CPU_Idle=1
```


* Q: The CoreFreq UI refreshes itself slowly, with a delay after the actual CPUs usage ?  
  A: The sampling time to read the counters can be reduced or increased using a CoreFreq module argument:  
:hash:`insmod corefreqk.ko SleepInterval=value`  
  where `<value>` is supplied in milliseconds between a minimum of 100 ms and a maximum of 4500 ms. 1000 ms is the default value.  


* Q: The base clock reports a wrong frequency value ?  
  A: CoreFreq uses various algorithms to estimate the base clock.  
  
  1. The delta of two TimeStamp counters during a defined interval  
  2. The value provided in the Processor brand string divided by the maximum ratio (without Turbo)  
  3. A static value advertised by the manufacturer specs.  
  4. The MSR_FSB_FREQ bits provided with the Core, Core2 and Atom architectures.  

  The CoreFreq module can be started as follow to ignore the first algorithm (frequency estimation):  
:hash:`insmod corefreqk.ko AutoClock=0`  
  _Remark: algorithms # 2, 3 and 4 will not return any under/over-clock frequency._  


* Q: The CPU temperature is wrong ?  
  A: CoreFreq employs two msr to calculate the temperature.  
```
MSR_IA32_TEMPERATURE_TARGET - MSR_IA32_THERM_STATUS [DTS]
```
  _Remark_: if the MSR_IA32_TEMPERATURE_TARGET is not provided by the Processor, a default value of 100 degree Celsius is considered as a target.  


* Q: The menu option "Memory Controller" does not open any window ?  
  A: Although Uncore and IMC features are under development, they can be activated with the Experimental driver argument:  
:hash:`insmod corefreqk.ko Experimental=1`  


* Q: The Instructions and PMC0 counters are stuck to zero ?  
  A: The PCE bit of control register CR4 allows RDPMC in ring 3  
:hash:`echo "2" > /sys/devices/cpu/rdpmc`  
:hash:`insmod corefreqk.ko RDPMC_Enable=1`  


* Q: How to solely control the OSPM or the HWP Performance P-States ?  
  A: Allow CoreFreq to register as a cpufreq driver.  
  In the Kernel boot command line, blacklist any P-state driver; such as:  
```
modprobe.blacklist=acpi_cpufreq,pcc_cpufreq intel_pstate=disable
```
  Start the CoreFreq driver with the `Register_CPU_Freq` parameter:  
```
insmod corefreqk.ko Register_CPU_Freq=1
```


* Q: The CPU freeze or the System crash.  
  A: This Processor is not or partially implemented in _CoreFreq_.  
  Please open an issue in the [CPU support](https://github.com/cyring/CoreFreq/wiki/CPU-support) Wiki page.  


* Q: What are the parameters of the driver ?
